Mamatha's Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and achievements in Web Development and Data Analytics.  
This site highlights my technical expertise, creative projects, and commitment to clarity and compact design.
Additionally, it includes a simple PHP script to handle form submissions.  
The script collects user input (name, email, mobile, and message), sanitizes it using `htmlspecialchars()`, and displays the submitted details back to the user.

- Footer with copyright and dynamic date/time
- Secure PHP form handling
